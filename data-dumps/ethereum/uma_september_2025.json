The quorum and voting period are minimum requirements for a proposal to be valid. Quorum and voting period values set for a specific proposal in Snapshot should be used if they are more strict than the rules parameter. Across uses custom quorum and threshold rules, which should be consulted to determine if a proposal is approved on Snapshot. These rules can be viewed in full at https://forum.across.to/t/across-governance-operating-manual/1447. For eligible votes that do not reach a quorum of 6000000, simulate a result that assumes 70% of the remaining votes are against the proposal. Do this by adding 70% of the remaining votes to be against the proposal and 30% in favor of the proposal. If this would still meet threshold requirements in favor of the proposal, the proposal can be considered passed. Not all proposal types are eligible for soft quorum. The proposal types that are eligible for soft quorum include Small Treasury Funding requests and Governance Updates. Small Treasury Funding is defined as “treasury distributions to proactively encourage the growth and development of the Across ecosystem valued below $50,000.” Governance Updates are defined as, “a vote to update a component of Across governance system.” Treasury funding requests valued at $150,000 or higher require a threshold of 66%, whereas all others are 51%.

The quorum and voting period are minimum requirements for a proposal to be valid. Quorum and voting period values set for a specific proposal in Snapshot should be used if they are more strict than the rules parameter. Across uses custom quorum and threshold rules, which should be consulted to determine if a proposal is approved on Snapshot. These rules can be viewed in full at https://forum.across.to/t/across-governance-operating-manual/1447. For eligible votes that do not reach a quorum of 6000000, simulate a result that assumes 70% of the remaining votes are against the proposal. Do this by adding 70% of the remaining votes to be against the proposal and 30% in favor of the proposal. If this would still meet threshold requirements in favor of the proposal, the proposal can be considered passed. Not all proposal types are eligible for soft quorum. The proposal types that are eligible for soft quorum include Small Treasury Funding requests and Governance Updates. Small Treasury Funding is defined as “treasury distributions to proactively encourage the growth and development of the Across ecosystem valued below $50,000.” Governance Updates are defined as, “a vote to update a component of Across governance system.” Treasury funding requests valued at $150,000 or higher require a threshold of 66%, whereas all others are 51%.

The quorum and voting period are minimum requirements for a proposal to be valid. Quorum and voting period values set for a specific proposal in Snapshot should be used if they are more strict than the rules parameter. Across uses custom quorum and threshold rules, which should be consulted to determine if a proposal is approved on Snapshot. These rules can be viewed in full at https://forum.across.to/t/across-governance-operating-manual/1447. For eligible votes that do not reach a quorum of 6000000, simulate a result that assumes 70% of the remaining votes are against the proposal. Do this by adding 70% of the remaining votes to be against the proposal and 30% in favor of the proposal. If this would still meet threshold requirements in favor of the proposal, the proposal can be considered passed. Not all proposal types are eligible for soft quorum. The proposal types that are eligible for soft quorum include Small Treasury Funding requests and Governance Updates. Small Treasury Funding is defined as “treasury distributions to proactively encourage the growth and development of the Across ecosystem valued below $50,000.” Governance Updates are defined as, “a vote to update a component of Across governance system.” Treasury funding requests valued at $150,000 or higher require a threshold of 66%, whereas all others are 51%.

The quorum and voting period are minimum requirements for a proposal to be valid. Quorum and voting period values set for a specific proposal in Snapshot should be used if they are more strict than the rules parameter. Across uses custom quorum and threshold rules, which should be consulted to determine if a proposal is approved on Snapshot. These rules can be viewed in full at https://forum.across.to/t/across-governance-operating-manual/1447. For eligible votes that do not reach a quorum of 6000000, simulate a result that assumes 70% of the remaining votes are against the proposal. Do this by adding 70% of the remaining votes to be against the proposal and 30% in favor of the proposal. If this would still meet threshold requirements in favor of the proposal, the proposal can be considered passed. Not all proposal types are eligible for soft quorum. The proposal types that are eligible for soft quorum include Small Treasury Funding requests and Governance Updates. Small Treasury Funding is defined as “treasury distributions to proactively encourage the growth and development of the Across ecosystem valued below $50,000.” Governance Updates are defined as, “a vote to update a component of Across governance system.” Treasury funding requests valued at $150,000 or higher require a threshold of 66%, whereas all others are 51%.

The quorum and voting period are minimum requirements for a proposal to be valid. Quorum and voting period values set for a specific proposal in Snapshot should be used if they are more strict than the rules parameter. Across uses custom quorum and threshold rules, which should be consulted to determine if a proposal is approved on Snapshot. These rules can be viewed in full at https://forum.across.to/t/across-governance-operating-manual/1447. For eligible votes that do not reach a quorum of 6000000, simulate a result that assumes 70% of the remaining votes are against the proposal. Do this by adding 70% of the remaining votes to be against the proposal and 30% in favor of the proposal. If this would still meet threshold requirements in favor of the proposal, the proposal can be considered passed. Not all proposal types are eligible for soft quorum. The proposal types that are eligible for soft quorum include Small Treasury Funding requests and Governance Updates. Small Treasury Funding is defined as “treasury distributions to proactively encourage the growth and development of the Across ecosystem valued below $50,000.” Governance Updates are defined as, “a vote to update a component of Across governance system.” Treasury funding requests valued at $150,000 or higher require a threshold of 66%, whereas all others are 51%.
