## NETWORK STATUS

### ✅ Active (2025)
- **Polygon V2:** 15,566 September assertions
- **Ethereum V3:** Active Oct 2025+ (0 September data)
- **Base V2/V3:** Active Oct 2025+ (0 September data)
- **Blast V2:** Active Oct 2025+ (0 September data)

### ❌ Inactive (2024 data)
- **Optimism:** Last activity Feb 2025
- **Ethereum V2:** Last activity Apr 2024
- **Arbitrum:** Last activity Apr 2024

---

## DISCOVERIES

### Subgraph Coverage
- **Before:** 2 networks (Polygon, Ethereum), 4 subgraphs
- **After:** 6 networks, 18 subgraphs (17 unique)
- **Working:** All use standard decentralized gateway API

### Schema Finding
- **"V1" Subgraphs:** Actually use V2 schema (mislabeled)
- **True V1:** Not found as distinct deployments
- **V2 vs V3:** Clearly documented and validated

### Activity Pattern
- **Polygon:** Dominant oracle network (100% Sept activity)
- **L2 Expansion:** Base, Blast, Ethereum V3 launched Oct 2025
- **Earlier L2s:** Optimism, Arbitrum largely inactive

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For September 2025 Analysis
✅ **Current analysis is COMPLETE and ACCURATE**
- Covers 100% of September 2025 oracle activity
- All active networks analyzed (only Polygon had data)
- No missing data

### For Expanded 2025 Analysis
📈 **Extend to Q4 2025 (Sept-Nov)**
- Include Base V2/V3 October-November data
- Include Ethereum V3 October-November data
- Include Blast V2 October-November data
- Show oracle ecosystem expansion

### For Historical Context
📚 **Analyze 2024 Data**
- Ethereum V2 (April 2024)
- Arbitrum V2 (April 2024)
- Optimism V2 (Feb 2025)
- Show usage decline on these networks

---

## TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

✅ Validated 18 subgraph IDs  
✅ Documented complete schema structures  
✅ Identified active vs inactive networks  
✅ Established activity timelines  
✅ Confirmed 100% September 2025 coverage  
✅ Created reusable fetch/analysis infrastructure  

---

## CONCLUSION

Your September 2025 analysis captures **100% of UMA Oracle activity** for that period. The apparent "gap" in other networks isn't missing data - those networks simply weren't active yet.

**Bottom Line:**
- September 2025 = Polygon only (15,566 assertions)
- October-November 2025 = Multi-network expansion
- Your analysis is complete and accurate for its time period
- No action needed unless expanding to Q4 2025
