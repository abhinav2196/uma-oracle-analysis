# Base - UMA Optimistic Oracle V3 (September 2025)

**Network:** Base  
**Oracle Version:** V3  
**Period:** September 1-30, 2025

---

## Summary

**Total Assertions:** 49  
**Crypto Price Predictions:** 3 (6.1%)  
**Primary Use Case:** Payment disputes

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Minimal Crypto Activity

Base shows **very minimal** crypto price prediction activity.

**Crypto Predictions:**
- **BTC:** 3 predictions
- **ETH:** 0
- **SOL:** 0
- **XRP:** 0

**Total:** 3 BTC predictions out of 49 assertions (6.1%)

### 2. Primary Use Case: Payment Disputes

**Majority of Base V3 activity (~90%):**

Payment dispute template:
```
"Two parties agreed on a contract to exchange a service/product for a payment. 
The contract details can be found in file:... 
The product/service was NOT delivered within contracted conditions and the payment 
should NOT be sent to the service/product provider and should be RETURNED to the payer."
```

**What this means:**
- Base V3 is used for P2P commerce dispute resolution
- Escrow-like functionality
- Evidence-based adjudication

### 3. Other Use Cases

**Non-payment assertions (~10%):**
- Social media claims (e.g., Truth Social memecoin launch)
- Timestamp-based verification
- Event outcomes

**Sample Claims:**
```
"Will a memecoin officially affiliated with Truth Social (TMTG) be launched by June 30"
"As of assertion timestamp 1717372583..."
```

### 4. Network Maturity

**Base is in early adoption:**
- Only 49 assertions in entire September
- Minimal Polymarket integration
- Mostly experimental/test usage

**Comparison to Polygon:**
- Polygon: 30,014 assertions
- Base: 49 assertions
- **Base is 0.16% of Polygon's volume**

---

## Economics

**Limited data (49 assertions):**
- Bond amounts: Varied
- Reward structure: Not standardized
- Currency: USDC (bridged to Base)

**Too small for meaningful economic analysis.**

---

## Why Base Has Minimal Activity

1. **Newer Network** - Launched 2023, still gaining adoption
2. **V3 Orientation** - Designed for assertions, not price predictions
3. **Polymarket Focus** - Polymarket primarily uses Polygon, not Base
4. **Cost Advantage Unclear** - Polygon already cheap enough

---

## Growth Potential

**Base could grow if:**
- Polymarket expands to Base for redundancy
- Base-native prediction markets emerge
- Economic incentives attract more users

**Current state:** Experimental, not production-scale

---

## Data Files

- `data-dumps/base/uma_september_2025.json` (49 assertions)
- `data-dumps/base/uma_september_2025_full.csv` (49 rows)
- `data-dumps/base/uma_september_2025_crypto_price_predictions.csv` (3 BTC predictions)

---

## Recommendation

**For crypto price analysis:** Base can be safely ignored (only 3 predictions, 0.02% of total).

**Monitor Base for:**
- Payment dispute patterns
- Network growth trends
- Future Polymarket expansion

---

**Conclusion:** Base V3 is nascent with minimal crypto price activity. Primary use case is payment disputes, not prediction markets.
