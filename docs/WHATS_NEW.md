## 🎯 CEO Questions - All Answered

Created `docs/CEO_FAQ.md` with comprehensive answers to:

### 1. ✅ Filter Logic & Examples
**Question:** What did the 7.5k requests look like?

**Answer:** 
- **Exact filter:** Must have crypto keyword AND price pattern
- **Keywords:** bitcoin, ethereum, xrp, btc, eth, solana, sol, cardano, ada, litecoin, ltc, dogecoin, doge
- **Patterns:** "will the price of" OR "price between $" OR "price (less|greater) than"
- **Real examples:** Included in FAQ with full query structure

### 2. ✅ Network Scope
**Question:** Have you only analyzed Polygon?

**Answer:** 
- **Current:** Yes, Polygon only (September 2025)
- **Reason:** Subgraph used was Polygon-specific
- **Networks available:** Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Gnosis
- **Next steps:** Multi-network infrastructure now ready

### 3. ⚠️ Proposer Latency
**Question:** How quickly did proposers respond?

**Status:** **Needs investigation**
- The `time` field is ambiguous (request time vs proposal time?)
- Need to clarify GraphQL schema
- May need to re-fetch with additional timestamp fields
- Plan outlined in FAQ

### 4. ✅ Data Quality Verification
**Question:** Did we filter exact requests like in screenshot?

**Answer:**
- Screenshot shows different oracle versions (V1 vs V2)
- Screenshot shows different networks (Ethereum vs our Polygon)
- Our filter CORRECTLY excluded non-price queries
- Recommended: Spot-check 100 random samples

## 🌐 Multi-Network Infrastructure

### New Scripts

1. **`fetch_uma_data.sh`** - Multi-network data fetcher
   ```bash
   ./fetch_uma_data.sh polygon september_2025
   ./fetch_uma_data.sh ethereum september_2025
   ```

2. **`convert_json_to_csv.sh`** - Network-aware converter
   ```bash
   ./convert_json_to_csv.sh polygon september_2025
   ```

3. **`filter_crypto_predictions.py`** - Updated Python filter
   ```bash
   python3 filter_crypto_predictions.py polygon september_2025
   ```

### New Configuration

- **`network-config.json`** - Centralized network settings
  - Polygon: ✅ Configured
  - Ethereum: ⚠️ Needs subgraph ID
  - Arbitrum: ⚠️ Needs subgraph ID
  - Optimism: ⚠️ Needs subgraph ID

### Security

- **API Key:** Now uses environment variable
- **`.gitignore`:** Updated to exclude `.env` files
- **No hardcoded keys:** All removed from scripts

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Can Do Now)

1. **Verify Data Quality**
   ```bash
   # Check 100 random samples from filtered data
   # Confirm all are legitimate crypto price predictions
   ```

2. **Set Up API Key**
   ```bash
   export THE_GRAPH_API_KEY='your_key_here'
   # Add to ~/.zshrc for persistence
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### Short Term (This Week)

4. **Find Ethereum Subgraph ID**
   - Go to https://thegraph.com/explorer
   - Search "UMA Optimistic Oracle v2 Ethereum"
   - Update `network-config.json`

5. **Fetch Ethereum Data**
   ```bash
   ./fetch_uma_data.sh ethereum september_2025
   ./convert_json_to_csv.sh ethereum september_2025
   python3 filter_crypto_predictions.py ethereum september_2025
   ```

6. **Compare Networks**
   - Polygon vs Ethereum volumes
   - Different proposer behaviors?
   - Different bond amounts?

### Medium Term (This Month)

7. **Investigate Latency**
   - Research GraphQL schema for timestamp fields
   - Determine if `time` is request or proposal time
   - Re-fetch with proper timestamps if needed

8. **Extend to Arbitrum & Optimism**
   - Find subgraph IDs
   - Fetch September 2025 data
   - Build cross-chain comparison

9. **Historical Analysis**
   - Add time periods to `network-config.json`
   - Analyze trends over multiple months
   - Compare September to October
