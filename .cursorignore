# Exclude large data dumps from AI context
# These files pollute the context window and reduce AI accuracy

# Data dumps directory
data-dumps/

# Large data files
*.csv
*.json
*.jsonl

# Archive and old files
archive/

# Test outputs
test-output/
test_results.txt

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp

# Node modules (if any)
node_modules/

# Keep AI focused on:
# - Active code (scripts/, sql-queries/)
# - Current documentation (docs/, reports/)
# - Configuration files (root level)
# 
# Note: You can still explicitly read ignored files when needed
